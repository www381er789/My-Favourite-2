                                        My Work
Hii!! 
This is Neha and today I am going to tell you about my work so let's get started.
In my freetime at home or school I always make something that helps my community,society,environment,pepole around me etc.
With the help of recycled materials like cardboard,old fabric,pastic etc.
By doing this we also help others and also learn something new.
I also use ideas obtained from my project and create some thing fabulous.
Some times I also create some thing for myself.
                                Thank You
