                                                                                       Inspiration





My insiparation is always my Parents .
Because they always guide me to the correct path so they are my inspiration.
My mother always taught me that When life gives you a hundred reasons to cry, SHOW LIFE that you have a thousand reasons TO SMILE.
And my father taught me that Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more.If you concentrate on what you don't have; you will never,ever have enough.
I always belive nothing is impossibe beacause the word "Impossible" itself has possible.
So nothing was hard in my life because bad time comes in everyone's life but that doesn't matter how you react on it that matters.
